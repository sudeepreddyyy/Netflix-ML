# 🎬 Netflix-Style Recommender System (ML Simulation)

I started this project to understand how **real-time recommendation systems like Netflix** work — how users transition through pages (Home, Search, Playback), and how machine learning can personalize their experience.

This end-to-end ML project simulates user behavior and builds recommendation engines using various techniques including Markov chains, Random Forests, collaborative filtering, and deep learning (autoencoders).

## 📚 Key Concepts Covered

- Session tracking: how users navigate Netflix-style platforms
- Markov Chains: transition modeling across pages
- Random Forest Classifier: predicting next page
- Collaborative Filtering: user-user & item-item similarity
- Deep Learning: autoencoder-based recommendation engine
- Data visualization: page flow as a graph
